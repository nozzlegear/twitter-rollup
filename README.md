A small node app which emails the tweets from a custom list of Twitter users. I've used this tool to successfully kick my Twitter addiction, as I can set it up to email a rollup once every day to stay "in the know" with the people I follow, but don't need to constantly check my Twitter feed to do so.

Required environment variables:

Name|Description
-------|------------------
`TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY`|The consumer key Twitter gives you when you create a Twitter app.
`TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET`|The consumer secret Twitter gives you when you create a Twitter app.
`TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN`|A bearer token generated by your Twitter app. You can have the Twitter dev dashboard automatically create one for personal use.
`TWITTER_ROLLUP_SENDER`|The email address to use as the email sender, e.g. example@example.com
`TWITTER_ROLLUP_RECIPIENT`|The email recipient, e.g. example@xample.com
`TWITTER_ROLLUP_SWU_KEY`|Your sendwithus.com API key, used for sending emails.
`TWITTER_ROLLUP_SWU_TEMPLATE`|Your sendwithus.com HTML template id.
`TWITTER_ROLLUP_FOLLOWS`|A comma separated list of Twitter usernames. These usernames will be used to generate the list of tweets.
